\chapter{Further references}
The appendix is mainly used to show additional plots, for example for distributions for other time windows than shown in the main matter.
These are often similar to each other and would otherwise clutter the main part too much.

The code written to enable the computational part of this analysis was mainly done in the \emph{Python} programming language, making heavy use of the scientific computing and visualization libraries \emph{numpy} \cite{numpy}, \emph{scipy} \cite{scipy}, \emph{matplotlib} \cite{matplotlib} and \emph{healpy} \cite{Gorski:2004by}.

\section{Notes on reproducibility}
The author tried to leave the analysis code in state that hopefully allows to reproduce the distribution used in this analysis.
Python is used as the programming language for both the core analysis code and for the scripts using that core code.
The scripts and data for both analysis can be found on the computing cluster of the IceCube collaboration at University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-Madison).
A numbering scheme is used to guide the execution order of the scripts.
Help strings are included, when additional command line argument are needed.

The core analysis code for the time-dependent analysis was written from scratch, but tried to keep a close connection to the existing \lstinline!skylab! code base used for many other IceCube point-source searches.
At the time of writing this thesis, the \lstinline!skylab! wasn't capable of handling the needed time-dependent variations of the extended Likelihood formalism though, making the self developed code necessary.
The code can be found in the \lstinline!github! repository at \url{github.com/mennthor/tdepps}.
This repository also includes spline and statistics related methods to provide the tools used during the evaluation of the analysis in the \lstinline!tdepps/utils! submodule.
The installation manual can be found in the modules \lstinline!Readme! file.
The scripts for the time-dependent analysis can be found on the UW-Madison cluster's file system under \lstinline!\home/tmenne/analysis/hese_transient_stacking_analysis!.
An additional \lstinline!Readme! file is provided with a short install manual.
The analysis folder itself is a \lstinline!git! repository so all changes can be tracked.
For the first setup, the required Python dependencies can be installed using the \lstinline!pip! package manager and the provided \lstinline!py2_requirements.txt! file.
In this analysis the branch \lstinline!original_hese! is used.
The master branch was intended to use an improved HESE sample event selection, \enquote{Pass2}, which was not ready at the time of this thesis and the original selection was used instead.
In general the analysis folder used \lstinline!git! branches and their names for the whole folder tree.
For this, a \lstinline!_loader.py! and \lstinline!_paths.py! module is provided.
These modules are used to handle all relative path dependencies and automatically set a new folder structure in the analysis folder and in the users data storage folder when a new branch is used.
This way, all tests cannot overwrite existing data or results and experiments can be done by simple branching.
The processing order loosely follows the steps presented in the analysis chapter~\ref{chp:time_dep}.
Some of the scripts simply run by themselves directly on the gateway machine.
However, trial generation takes quite some computing time.
The trial generation scripts are therefore usually split into three parts, where the first one creates job files for the \lstinline!dagman! distributed computing system, the second one resembles the actual code to be executed in each job and the last one is usually a script that collects and combines all the results from the job files in a more compact data structure.
For this analysis, all results are stored in a human readable form in the \lstinline!JSON! file format.
Because the format has no compression and can be quite verbose for a large datasets, the \lstinline!gzip! compression algorithm is used to compress the files if necessary.
The handling of these files in Python is quite easy as demonstrated in the following listing
\begin{lstlisting}
  import json
  import gzip
  fname = "path/to/file.json.gz"
  # 'gzip' may be optional, use just 'open(...)' then
  with gzip.open(fname, "r") as fp:
    data_dict = json.load(fp)
\end{lstlisting}

For the time-integrated search the existing \lstinline!skylab! core analysis code was used.
Apart from that, the analysis is structured as explained above for the time-dependent analysis.
The Likelihood map signal injector was not available to the date when it was needed in the \lstinline!skylab! core code.
Due to the similar code structure between the self-developed \lstinline!tdepps! and the \lstinline!skylab! code, a simple adapter method was used to inject the signal events as needed by the \lstinline!skylab! code.
The analysis folder can also be found on the UW-Madison cluster file system at the path \lstinline!/analysis/hese_time_independent_stacking_fit_index!.

Unfortunately, the code to perform certain post-processing analysis steps, as the $\chi^2$ fits or code for producing the plots in this thesis completely resides in \lstinline!IPython! notebooks.
Although these have been copied to the respective analysis folders on the UW-Madison machine, this is not very beneficial for reproducibility.
The author can only recommend the reader to proceed otherwise with his analysis evaluation and make these accessible in standard scripts too.

\section{Acknowledgements}
It would not have been possible to finish this thesis without the help and support of many people.
Trying to thank each and everyone of them would consequently lead to missing acknowledgement for sure.
Therefore, I only want to address some of them directly at this place, but also express my gratitude to everyone who participated in any way during the creation of this work and in general during my studies at the university Dortmund.

Firstly I want to thank my parents for making it possible in the first place, with every small decision they made, for me to finish the physics education and the doctoral studies.
I also want to thank my wife for her support even though the writing of this thesis did take much longer than expected.

Furthermore I want to thank my supervisor Dr.~Dr.~Wolfgang~Rhode for his professional and the financial support, as well as Dr.~Bernhardt~Spaan in his role as second corrector and the other two members of the defence committee Dr.~BÃ¤rbel~Siegmann and Dr.~Mirko~Cinchetti.

Lastly, many thanks go to my colleagues at the astroparticle physics chair at TU Dortmund, who helped me with many details and went through the pain of proof-reading of this thesis.
