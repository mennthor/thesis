\chapter{Time integrated analysis}

Another analysis was performed to test for a potential steady flux scenario from the HESE event positions.


\section{Per event distribution modelling}
Different because skylab was used.

\subsection*{Spatial PDF}
Gaussian PDF differences

\subsection*{Energy PDF}
Describe construction with variable gamma


\section{Background estimation and stacking weights}
Weights are same, but discuss differences in binning


\section{Note on LLH minimization}
Maybe discuss derivative in ns and gamma?


\section{Trial generation}
Discuss differences

\subsection*{Background trials}
Trials are much simpler made by scrambling background

\subsection*{Signal trials}
Discuss difference fluence burst mode vs. constant flux injection.
Mention, that chi2 method is the same.
Use skylab module or adapt own healpy injector?


\section{Results}
