\chapter{Outlook}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Include multimessenger topic somehow
  \item Recap that larger time window for neutrino is emission seems at least likely
  \item Try to explain that this analysis is rather good for finding interesting spots to look at in other wavelengths for more concrete physics results.
  Dedicated model searches or expanded observation time at the HESE tracks may yield more insight in other messenger particles.
\end{itemize}
