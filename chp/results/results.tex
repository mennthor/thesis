\chapter{Results}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Analysis results, plain numbers, orient at FRB or GRB for example.
  Both for time independent and dependent stacking
  \item present the limit scan pre-trial and post-trial, try to add a somewhat meaningful comparison curve to the plots, eg. diffuse HESE or diffuse Aachen.
  \item Compare emission scenarios to (somewhat) likely scenarios from the intro section
  \item Compare both results in light of the TXS result, trend to larger time windows
\end{itemize}
