\chapter{Reconstruction and data}

The naming scheme for data taken in each period is thus following the number of operational strings until the complete detector.
After that the data taking periods are numbered consecutively with the corresponding year.

\TODO{Describe data sample specifics. Seperate description for atmo, astro and muon constribution from the sample point of view.}

\begin{itemize}
  \item PS sample charaecteristics, explain pull correction
  \item Muons and numu from atmosphere and possible astrophysical content from diffuse
  \item HESE sample and connection to source physics from intro, pass2 new HESEs, motivation for track only, connection to L. Schumacher?
  \item Directional reconstruction: SplineMPE and milliped scans, coordinate systems: local to equatorial
  \item Energy reconstruction and connection to neutrino spectra
  \item simulation and systematics overview
\end{itemize}
