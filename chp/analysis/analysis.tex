\chapter{Analysis}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Describe how HESE maps are build, systematic smearing
\end{itemize}

\section{Time dependent neutrino search}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Used parameter space
  \item How PDFs and trials are done exactly
  \item Explain details how fitter was used, the seed was found, signal injection, BG injection, BG rate description
  \item Systematic tests: Signal found
  \item Show sensitivity, signal injection, bg injection, ref to MRichman
  \item Systematics: Injection varies but test fixed, systematic signal sets
\end{itemize}

\section{Time independent search with fitted source positions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Depends on whether toy is used or real analysis
  \item Connection to PDFs from previous chapter
  \item Explain details how fitter was used, the seed was found, signal injection BG scrambling
  \item Systematic tests: Signal found, fit stability, FE gradients from map, local profile scans
  \item Show sensitivity
  \item Systematic signal injection, if on real data?
\end{itemize}
